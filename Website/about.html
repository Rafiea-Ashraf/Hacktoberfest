                <h3>Mission:</h3>
                <p>Due to false alarm coming from sensors a lot of times, sometimes people missed the actual alarm and it causes some serious damage. Our mission is to overcome this and make a cost friendly project that can detect the false alarm and stop it.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="overview-item">
                <h3>Vision:</h3>
                <p>As we strive to create the ideal alarm detector, our vision is anchored in harnessing the power of AI. By employing cutting-edge artificial intelligence technologies, we aim to revolutionize the way data is analyzed, ensuring that each reading is not just accurate, but consistently precise. Our commitment lies in crafting a detector that seamlessly integrates AI capabilities to deliver unmatched reliability and effectiveness.</p>

            <div class="overview-item">
                <h3>Values:</h3>
                <p>When we build these detectors, we want them to be trustworthy and considerate, so they don't make mistakes or cause unnecessary worry. By sticking to good values, the detector can be more reliable and respectful in its job.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="overview-item">
                <h3>Goals:</h3>
                <p> It aims to become adept at identifying genuine emergencies swiftly and accurately, while also avoiding the issuance of false alarms that could needlessly unsettle people. By defining clear goals, the detector gains a sense of purpose and direction, enabling it to navigate the complexities of its task with precision and reliability.</p>
