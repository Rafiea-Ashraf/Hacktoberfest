                <ul>
                    <li>Feature 1: It takes live reading of all four sensors conneting in it.</li>
                    <li>Feature 2: Our project is connected to this website that will contains and shows all the reading of sensors.</li>
                    <li>Feature 3: System checks whether the alarm coming form sensors is a correct one and then act according to it.</li>
                    <li>Feature 4: Our system has a User-friendly interface and is easy to use.</li>
                    <li>Feature 5: Advanced data analytics capabilities that makes it an AI-based alarm detector.</li>
